Objective

Detect sales-entry errors early, improve billing discipline, and prevent month-end inventory shocks without increasing doctor involvement.
This system is designed for a non-barcode, manually entered pharmacy where small errors are frequent due to speed, repetition, and name ambiguity.

DAILY CHECKLIST (20–30 minutes)

Runs every working day → 
Filter Sales Register to High-Risk medicines → 
Group name variants used that day →
Update variant mapping list (if new variants appear) →
Calculate expected closing stock for each High-Risk medicine →
Compare with physical closing stock →
Flag only material deviations beyond tolerance →
Randomly audit 3–5 bills →
Log errors (no punishment, only correction)

WEEKLY CHECKLIST (15 minutes)
Review Error Log for repeated patterns
Identify medicines with ≥3 similar errors
Decide action:
Staff retraining
Billing SOP clarification
Escalation (only if material)
Share 1-page summary internally

STEP 1 — IDENTIFY HIGH-RISK MEDICINES (ONE-TIME)
Selection logic (behavior-driven):
Medicines typed repeatedly every day (fatigue errors)
Similar or abbreviated names (auto-completion by brain)
Frequently prescribed by doctor
Treatment-critical availability
High-Risk Medicine List
Medicine (Master Name)
Why High Risk
Dolo 650
Very high daily volume → shortcut typing
Azithromycin 500
Frequently abbreviated or misspelled
Pantoprazole 40
High prescription frequency

(This list is reviewed monthly.)

STEP 2 — DAILY NAME-VARIATION CHECK (10 minutes)
What is done daily:
Filter sales entries to High-Risk medicines only
Visually group similar or abbreviated names
Variant Mapping Table
Entered Name Variant
Mapped To
Dolo / Dolo kind
Dolo 650
Azithro 500 / Azithromycin
Azithromycin 500

What is flagged:
New variants not seen earlier
Misspellings causing ambiguity
Action:
Add variant to mapping list
Inform billing staff same day to use standard name
No correction penalty. Focus is awareness and standardization.

STEP 3 — DAILY USAGE REASONABLENESS CHECK
For each High-Risk medicine:
Expected Closing Stock
= Opening Stock + Purchases − Total Sales (after variant grouping)
Sample Check Table
Medicine
Expected Stock
Actual Stock
Difference
Action
Dolo 650
1,460
1,440
−20
Review sales entries

Tolerance Rule:
±2% or ±5 units (whichever is higher)
Why tolerance exists:
Manual entry systems are imperfect
Goal is early pattern detection, not daily reconciliation

STEP 4 — RANDOM BILL SPOT CHECK (5–10 minutes)
Process:
Randomly select 3–5 bills containing High-Risk medicines
Verify:
Medicine name matches master
Quantity is reasonable vs prescription
Why random checks:
Staff never knows which bill is checked
Encourages consistent caution across all bills
Improves discipline without supervision pressure

STEP 5 — ERROR PATTERN TRACKING (WEEKLY)
Error Log (Example)
Date
Medicine
Error Type
Repeated?
Aug 1
Dolo 650
Name variant
Yes
Aug 3
Dolo 650
Quantity mismatch
No

Decision Rules:
Same error ≥3 times → retraining
Multiple medicines affected → SOP update
Single, non-repeating errors → logged only

STEP 6 — DOCTOR ESCALATION RULES
Doctor is involved only if:
Financial impact is material
Pattern persists despite correction
Inventory mismatch affects treatment availability
All clerical noise is absorbed by the system.
